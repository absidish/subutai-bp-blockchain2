Since then, GIMPS has found a total of 16 Mersenne primes. This may not sound as much, but considering only 50 has ever been found and that 14 of those 16 at the time they were found were the largest known prime numbers.</p><p>GIMPS achieve this collaborative efford by providing a piece of software known as <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/download/" target="_blank">Prime95</a>. While there is nothing complicated about installing Prime95, <a href="https://subutai.io" target="_blank">Subutai</a> is all about sharing otherwise idle resources, and thus makes it the perfect platform on which to deploy Prime95.</p><p>This page describes in details how to deploy Prime95 on the Subutai platform.</p><h2>Sign up</h2><p>Head to <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/update/" target="_blank">Get Started/Create Account</a> on <a href="https://www.mersenne.org">mersenne.org</a> and register a new account. Remember your Login as you will need this later. Once logged in, your name will be displayed in a green box in the upper right hand corner.</p><img src="img/signed-in.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Mersenne.org Signed In"><h2>Deploy GIMPS Blueprint</h2><p>First sign in to the <a href="https://bazaar.subutai.io">Subutai Bazaar</a>. If this is your first time using Subutai, follow the steps <a href="#!/bp-wp">here</a> to sign up and add necessary peers. For this blueprint, no domain is necessary.</p><p>Now select Products in the left hand side menu and select the GIMPS Blueprint.</p><img src="img/gimps-2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="GIMPS Blueprint"><p>Click the blue Build button.</p><img src="img/gimps-3.png" class="img-fluid" alt="GIMPS Form"><p>Fill in the form with the appropriate information. Most important is that the primeUser variable must match the login name that you were choosing when your registered on mersenne.org.</p><p>Since this blueprint does not require any incoming port mappings the next page is empty. Simply click the Next button and you will be taken to the peer selection form.</p><img src="img/gimps-4.png" class="img-fluid" alt="GIMPS Peer Selection"><p>Select a peer with idle resources - preferably of course one of your own. Click "Next" and finally on the last page of the wizard press the Build button.</p><img src="img/gimps-5.png" class="img-fluid" alt="GIMPS Env Building"><p>After a few minutes your new Subutai Environment should be ready and running and you are now contributing to the search for ever larger Prime numbers. Depending on which hostname you chose, after a few minutes you should see your new CPU show up in the statistics on mersenne.org:</p><img src="img/gimps-6.png" class="img-fluid" alt="GIMPS CPU"><p>And that is it - you are now helping the search for primes. Time to deploy another one?</p>
